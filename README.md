# odin-recipes

In this project, I will build a HTML recipes website. The website will consist of a main index page with links to a few pages with their own recipes. The index page should have a title and an unordered list of links to each of the recipes. 
The recipe pages should have the following setup:
A link to the index page. 
An image of the recipe.
A description title followed by a short description of the recipe. 
An ingredients title followed by an unordered list of ingredients. 
Finally, a steps title followed by an ordered list of the steps to assemble the recipe.
