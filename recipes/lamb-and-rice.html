    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These lamb and rice stuffed grape leaves take some time and effort to put together, so maybe make a double batch. In restaurants these are usually meatless, but I love the lamb in these. No matter what you use, how much rice you use will affect how much liquid you need.</p>
